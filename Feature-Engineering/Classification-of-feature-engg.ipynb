    "Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or data to help machine learning models learn patterns more effectively. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processes Involved in Feature Engineering : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Feature Transformation:* Transformation adjusts features to improve model learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Normalization & Scaling: Adjust the range of features for consistency.\n",
    "    - Encoding: Converts categorical data to numerical form i.e one-hot encoding.\n",
    "    - Mathematical transformations: Like logarithmic transformations for skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Feature Creation/Construction:* Feature creation involves generating new features from domain knowledge or by observing patterns in the data. It can be:\n",
    "    - Domain-specific: Created based on industry knowledge like business rules.\n",
    "    - Data-driven: Derived by recognizing patterns in data.\n",
    "    - Synthetic: Formed by combining existing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Feature Extraction:* Extracting meaningful features can reduce dimensionality and improve model accuracy:\n",
    "    - Dimensionality reduction: Techniques like PCA reduce features while preserving important information.\n",
    "    - Aggregation & Combination: Summing or averaging features to simplify the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Feature Selection :* Feature selection involves choosing a subset of relevant features to use:\n",
    "    - Filter methods: Based on statistical measures like correlation.\n",
    "    - Wrapper methods: Select based on model performance.\n",
    "    - Embedded methods: Feature selection integrated within model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Feature Scaling:* Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model:\n",
    "    - Min-Max scaling: Rescales values to a fixed range like 0 to 1.\n",
    "    - Standard scaling: Normalizes to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1."
