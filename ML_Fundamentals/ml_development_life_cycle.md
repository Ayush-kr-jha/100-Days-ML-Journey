# Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)

The Machine Learning Development Life Cycle defines the **end-to-end steps**
to build, deploy, and maintain an ML system.



## 1️. Problem Definition
- Clearly define the problem and goal
- Decide the ML task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.)



## 2️. Data Collection
- Collect relevant data from databases, APIs, or web scraping
- Ensure data represents the real-world scenario



## 3️. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates
- Normalize or transform data if required



## 4️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand data distribution and relationships
- Use simple visualizations to find patterns



## 5️. Feature Engineering
- Select useful features
- Create new features to improve performance



## 6️. Model Selection
- Choose the right algorithm for the problem
- Balance accuracy, interpretability, and resources



## 7️. Model Training
- Split data into train and validation sets
- Train the model and tune hyperparameters



## 8️. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate using suitable metrics
- Ensure good performance on unseen data



## 9️. Model Deployment
- Deploy the model for real-world usage
- Integrate with applications or services



## 10. Maintenance & Monitoring
- Monitor performance over time
- Retrain when data or behavior changes



## Key Takeaway
> ML is not just training a model, it’s a **continuous cycle** of improvement.
