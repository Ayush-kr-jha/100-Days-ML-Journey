# MLDLC (Machine Learning Development Life Cycle)

1. Problem Definition:
    - Clearly define the problem to be solved and the objectives of the machine learning project.
    - Identify the type of machine learning task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
2. Data Collection:
    - Gather relevant data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or web scraping.
    - Ensure the data is representative of the problem domain.
3. Data Preprocessing:
    - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
    - Transform and normalize the data as needed for model training.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Analyze the data to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between features.
    - Visualize the data using charts and graphs to identify patterns and insights.
5. Feature Engineering:
    - Select relevant features and create new features that may improve model performance.
    - Perform dimensionality reduction if necessary to reduce complexity.   
6. Model Selection:
    - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the problem type and data characteristics.
    - Consider factors such as interpretability, scalability, and computational resources.
7. Model Training:
    - Split the data into training and validation sets.
    - Train the selected model(s) using the training data and tune hyperparameters as needed.
8. Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
    - Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
9. Model Deployment:
    - Deploy the trained model into a production environment for real-world use.
    - Monitor the model's performance and update it as needed based on new data or changing conditions.
10. Maintenance and Monitoring:
    - Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with new data.
    - Address any issues that arise, such as model drift or changes in data distribution.  
11. Documentation and Reporting:
    - Document the entire machine learning development process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation results.
    - Communicate findings and insights to stakeholders through reports and presentations.
